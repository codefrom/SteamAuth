Some usage examplex:
## Accept/deny confirmation
1) Create SteamGuardAccount with appropriate config
2) Call UserLoginService.DoLogin with username and password
2.1) If LoginResult.State = LoginResultState.NEED_2FA then call UserLoginService.DoLogin, but now set Requires2FA to true and TwoFactorCode to SteamGuardAccount.GenerateSteamGuardCode value for request
2.2) If LoginResult.State = LoginResultState.NEED_CAPTCHA then call UserLoginService.DoLogin, but now set RequiresCaptcha to true, CaptchaGID to CaptchaGID from response and CaptchaText to text from CAPTCHA at "https://steamcommunity.com/public/captcha.php?gid=" + CaptchaGID
3) Set received session to the SteamGuardAccount
4) Call SteamGuardAccount.FetchConfirmations to get array of confirmations
5.1) Call SteamGuardAccount.AcceptConfirmation to accept confirmation
